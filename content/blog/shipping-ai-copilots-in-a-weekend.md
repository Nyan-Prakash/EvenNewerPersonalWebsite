summary: "A behind-the-scenes look at my rapid prototyping stack for AI copilots. From prompt design, to instrumenting user feedback, to deploying on Vercel edge functionsâ€”this is how I go from idea to something teammates can actually use in under 48 hours."

Launch velocity matters. I treat every AI sidekick like a Friday hackathon project: scope it to one magical moment, instrument everything, and ship while the excitement is still peaking.

### My current weekend stack

- Figma storyboard to map the conversation flow in under 30 minutes.
- TypeScript edge functions on Vercel with a thin Remix-style router for prompts.
- PostHog event stream hooked to every model call and human override.
- Airtable ops dashboard so teammates can nudge instructions without redeploying.

The real unlock is capturing live feedback. I record every improvement suggestion as a structured ticket. By Sunday, the backlog writes the next prompt iteration for me.

> Shipping beats polishing. Users remember the velocity more than the pixel-perfect UI.

Next up: migrate the telemetry layer to a shared event bus so each new copilot inherits analytics, guardrails, and release notes without extra wiring.
